A static site generator is a software application that creates HTML pages from templates or components and a given content source. Most static site generators, including Gatsby, accept Markdown-formatted text files as a source, although Gatsby is not limited to Markdown.

Static site generators are an alternative to database-driven content management systems, such as WordPress and Drupal. In such systems, content is managed and stored in a database. When the server receives a request for a particular URL, a software layer retrieves data from the database, merges it with template files, and generates an HTML page as its response.
